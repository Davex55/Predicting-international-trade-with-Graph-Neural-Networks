## Introduction 
International trade plays a pivotal role in modern economies. Its intricacies, compounded by the inherently uncertain nature of politics, have historically posed formidable challenges to predictive models. Most proposed methods have overlooked critical factors such as country-to-country relationships such as economic openness.

This study addresses the issue of forecasting international trade through the application of the stateof-the-art  Deep Learning Graph Neural Network architecture. Unlike conventional models like , which often analyze separate time series, is capable of modeling multiple country-to-country relationships, harnessing both temporal and spatial data at the same time. A significant contribution of this research lies in the creation of the graph that represents countryto- country interactions. In this framework, two countries are deemed similar (and, therefore, connected by an edge in the graph) if they share significant economic ties. This graph structure is an essential component in Deep Learning architectures like , which rely on Graph Neural Networks.

The study will compare the results generated by with those from . Our experiments demonstrate that, in terms of prediction accuracy, our Deep Learning-based model outperforms the traditional approach across various aspects.
